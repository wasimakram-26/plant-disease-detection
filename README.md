# Plant Disease Detection Using Leaf Images

A MATLAB-based project to classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Features
- Train CNN on leaf image dataset
- Predict plant disease for new images
- Measure test accuracy

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2019 or later
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add leaf images in `leaf_dataset/` folder (subfolders for each class).
3. Run `plant_disease_detection.m`.
4. Accuracy will be printed and predictions shown on new images.
